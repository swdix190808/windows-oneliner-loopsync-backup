No reason why anyone using Windows should ever loose data using this backup method (hello city governments).  
Easily send results to your encrypted containers using Windows alias methods.  No subscriptions or fees. Backup as often as you need, every minute, ten minutes, or once a day (enter number of seconds). Database users have to a copy of the database closed due to multi user locking issues.
