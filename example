# this is not a program per se ...
# you copy this example into a dos terminal or 
# from the Run prompt
# create two alias for x and y
# alias means assign a drive letter to a path

cmd /C "FOR /L %N IN DO robocopy x:\ y:\ /e & timeout 600"

# (do a loop) (this program) (source/desination) (wait 10 min)
# See Windows help if you do not understand assigning a 
# drive letter to a path or network share
# this can be done with file verification programs as well.
# this technique combines two public known tools
# the example given is safe, it does not use MIR which can
# delete files (see robocopy help file)
# XP users replace & timeout with & your.vbs
# VBS one liner in a file:  wacript.sleep 600
# (yes that worked for me without calling an object)

# Advantage:  no mysterious methods or subroutines to audit
# no libraries vulnerable to errors, nothing to install
# Microsoft will break this if it ever become a problem.
# free logging you can have another alias to 
# an encrypted file system and redirect output there
# in plain text (> z:\logfile.txt)
# Basic command line skills and understanding required
# this method uses two known free tools
# no excuse why any government should loose all their data
# the command line must stay open or make this a service
# You must run this as admin or configure UAC 
# Casual home users can create a bat file with this line 
# then just right click and run as admin
# it will send a copy of your data where you set the alias
